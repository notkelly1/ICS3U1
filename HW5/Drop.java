/* 

Goal: The height of an object at any given time dropped from a starting height of 100 meters is given by the equation h = 100 â€“ 4.9t2 
where t is the time in seconds.  
Write a program that prompts the user for a time less than 4.5 seconds and then displays the height of the object at that time.
